ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction System
This project is a machine learning-based predictive system designed to identify the presence of heart disease using various clinical and demographic features. It includes:

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Model Training & Evaluation using multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)

Performance Comparison based on Accuracy, F1-score, AUC, and Execution Time

The system empowers users to understand key factors influencing heart disease and helps choose the most effective model based on statistical performance.
